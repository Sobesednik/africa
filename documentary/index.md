`africa` is a _Node.JS_ package which simplifies reading from and writing to persistent configuration files in user's home directory. If a configuration exists, it will be read, and if not, the user will be presented with questions, after which the answers will be stored in the `.rc` file.

```sh
yarn add africa
```
